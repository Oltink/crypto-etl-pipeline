# crypto-etl-pipeline
his project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for cryptocurrency data processing. It fetches real-time price data from public APIs, processes it, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database and Google BigQuery for further analysis. The pipeline is built using Apache Airflow for orchestration and Apache Kafka for real-time streaming.
